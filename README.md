# A-Level Coding Projects
This repository contains coding projects that I completed as part of my A-level studies. These projects were completed to help me develop my coding skills and understand key concepts in computer science (not really).

## Projects Included
- Project 1: Login Register - Simple login and register system
- Project 2: Tasks - Application for task noting

## Getting Started
To view the projects in this repository, you can clone the repository onto your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/jankubatt/Maturita.git```

Each project is contained within its own folder, with the project's name as the folder name. Within each project folder, you will find the source code files and any additional files required to run the project.

## Prerequisites
To run these projects, you will need to have PHP and XAMPP installed on your computer. Additionally, you may need to install any additional libraries or dependencies required by each project.

## Contributing
As this repository contains completed projects from my A-level studies, I am not actively seeking contributions at this time. However, if you have suggestions for improvements or spot any issues, feel free to create an issue in the repository.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to my teachers and peers who helped me develop my coding skills and complete these projects.
